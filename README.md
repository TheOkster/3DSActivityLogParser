This is a small project to analyze the pld.dat file stored inside the 3DS Activity Log save file. It outputs the parsed data as a CSV.
Right now, it should recognize 3DS, DSi, and eShop titles. DS, homebrew, demos, and custom added titles are not recognized right now. If there's a list of CTR TitleIDs somewhere for them, please let me know.

Note I haven't actually tested this on 3DS systems other than my own, so please let me know if this doesn't work.

The 3dsreleases.xml is from 3dsdb.com.
DSi.csv was scraped from [here](https://3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_DSiWare_Titles), System.csv was scraped from [here](https://3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_DSiWare_Titles](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Title_list)https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Title_list).
I believe eShop.csv was scraped from [here](https://hax0kartik.github.io/3dsdb/static.html), but I'm not completely sure since I made this project around 6 months before publishing it on GitHub.
